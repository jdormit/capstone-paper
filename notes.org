* Thoughts on the paper
- I'll need to connect Lyotard's understanding of "knowledge" with Stallman's understanding of "code"
This connection is the key to the whole paper - Lyotard argues that knowledge has become commoditized and exterior to the individual, while Stallman says that code is packaged up and distributed and sold as a "mysterious bunch of numbers", which cannot be understood. Basically, the packaging of code is like the packaging and exteriorization of knowledge.
